### 1. Assigned Target
* Design a product/inventory management system API and create Documentaion for it. The API must be documented using Swagger Tools. API must conform to OpenAPI specifications.

### 2. My Goals
* Design and Document API
* Conform to the guiding constraints of REST Architecture
* Implement an API using Express and Mongo DB
* Use passport for user Authentication
* Assign fixed constraints on attributes of products in a noSQL database

### 3. REST 6 guiding constraints and How my API is RESTful
* My API follows 5 of the guiding constraints. I Have made sure to use HATEOS in GET requests. This improves discoverability of resources through published set of links (provided with response) and Indicates to Clients what actions can be taken next.
* I have implemented basic client side caching behavior in one of my get request to get list of products.
* Followed naming conventions that represent hierarchy.
